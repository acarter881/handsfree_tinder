Making Tinder's Desktop Application Hands-Free

## Usage
- You'll need Google Chrome running on localhost. See [this video](https://youtu.be/FVumnHy5Tzo) for details.
- Run the Python script. If there any are modules you don't have, Google how to install them.
- You'll need a basic microphone. The microphone I used is from the Astro A40s.
- The speech-to-text work comes from [Google's Speech-To-Text API](https://cloud.google.com/speech-to-text)
